__GATE_CHAIN__

The build step is a documented no-op before the workspace contains its first
package, matching the workspace quality workflow.

The quality job's effective permissions must be exactly `contents: read`, and
every remote action or reusable workflow must be pinned to a full 40-character
commit SHA. Keep version comments and GitHub Actions Dependabot configuration
so those pins remain maintainable.

Branch protection must require the separate `quality` and `compliance` status
checks. Quality executes the gate chain; compliance independently checks the
repository against the standard. Keep these canonical names so the same
ruleset applies to every adopting repository.
